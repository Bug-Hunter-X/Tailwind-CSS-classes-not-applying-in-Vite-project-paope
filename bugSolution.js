The issue was resolved by explicitly setting the `content` option in my `tailwind.config.js` to include the correct paths to my template files.  Previously, the `content` array was empty, preventing Tailwind from correctly parsing the class names. Here is the updated `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Additionally, verifying that the `postcss.config.js` file was correctly configured and that the `npm run build` command was correctly executed is also important.  Ensuring the `vite.config.js` properly includes the Tailwind plugin is also crucial.  The previous `vite.config.js` file, which may be incomplete or incorrectly configured, may be found in `bug.js`.
